## Structure and folders
* **R**: contains the functions of the package. All functions placed here will be imported when using "devtools::load_all()". Currently all functions are inside the R file sampling. This may change in the future.
* **man**: documentation of the package. This is automatized through the package roxygen2.
* **tests**: contains the tests of the package. Each R file is associated to a function in the package. 
* **scripts**: contains scripts that use the functions of the package. The simulation script is located here. 
* **docs**: additional documentation of the package manually generated. 
* **data**: contains data to be used in the examples of the package.

## Testing status (74.1% test coverage)

> Test coverage is defined as a metric in Software Testing that measures the amount of testing performed by a set of tests. It will include gathering information about which parts of a program are executed when running the test suite to determine which branches of conditional statements have been taken into account.

* **bayesianUpdateBinomial** (Total tests: `r sum(testing[testing$context == "bayesianUpdateBinomial", 'nb'])`)
  * Scope 1 - Specific example:
    * Prior: uniform
    * Treatments: 3
    * Sample size: 6
  * Scope 2 - Random example:
    * Prior: random beta
    * Treatments: 6
    * Sample size: random (3 times)
  * Subject:
    * Output size.
    * Correct computation of posterior parameters.
    * Parameters greater than 0.

* **sampleDistribution** (Total tests: `r sum(testing[testing$context == "sampleDistribution", 'nb'])`)
  * Scope 1 - Random example:
    * Sample resolution: 100k
    * Prior: random beta
    * Treatments: 4
    * Sample size: random (3 times)
  * Subject:
    * Mean from the sample draws is close to the theoretical mean of the posterior distribution with 0.001 tolerance.
    * Variance from the sample draws is close to the theoretical variance of the posterior distribution with 0.001 tolerance.
    * Skewness from the sample draws is close to the theoretical skewness of the posterior distribution with 0.05 tolerance.
    
* **thompsonSampling** (Total tests: `r sum(testing[testing$context == "thompsonSampling", 'nb'])`)
  * Scope 1 - Random example:
    * Prior: random beta
    * Treatments: 4
    * Sample size: random (5 times)
  * Subject:
    * Check that the sum of the p-shares is equal to 1.
    * (TODO) Test case when Thompson p-share(d1) = 1
    * (TODO) Check asymptotic behavior
    
* **explorationSampling** (Total tests: `r sum(testing[testing$context == "explorationSampling", 'nb'])`)
  * Scope 1 - Random example:
    * Prior: random beta
    * Treatments: 4
    * Sample size: random (5 times)
  * Subject:
    * Check that the sum of the p-shares is equal to 1.
    * (TODO) Test case when exploration p-share(d1) = 1
    * (TODO) Check asymptotic behavior
    
* **proportionalAssignment** (Total tests: `r sum(testing[testing$context == "proportionalAssignment", 'nb'])`)
  * Scope 1 - Random example:
    * Prior: random beta
    * Treatments: 3
    * Sample size: random (3 times)
    * Simulation runs: 1k
  * Subject:
    * Check that the empirically asymptotic p-shares are close to the true treatment p-share with a tolerance of 0.01.
    
## Scripts
* **simulation.R**: implementation of a simulation to observe the behavior of the exploration sampling p-shares under different scenarios.
  * Scope: 
    * Variable number of treatments
    * Variable treatment effects
    * Variable number of waves
    * Variable sample size
    * Fixed sample size across waves
